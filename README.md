CRYPTO PRICE TRACKER

https://cryptotrackerbasic.netlify.app

- Crypto currency price tracker for those who wants to invest.

- TASK FOR MYSELF IN THIS PROJECT: Build a site that people can see all the crypto currencies, their current prices, their volumes, their market caps and the price changes in the last 24 hours, so that they can analyze between currencies. Also they should be able to search for a currency and see the live informations about that currency.


- What was the best practices for me in this project: I have used React Hooks such as useState and useEffect. Also I have fetch the currencies live data from an API. I’ve used axios library for fetching the data.
